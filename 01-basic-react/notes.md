### most basic way to download react is 
`npx create-react-app` 

### we won't be downloading it, since it wastes time.

### but this is a very bulky install, so it could take an hour, since installed bundles r very heavy.

# hence, its a better idea to use a build tool like `vite`, `parcel`, or `rsbuild`. 


## -- installing vite -- 
npm install vite@latest
